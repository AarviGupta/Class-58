        <h1> Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England,[26] the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is an expert on greenhouse gases. His parents were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1.<br><br>
            He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.<br><br>
            He studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class bachelor of arts degree in physics.[1] While at university, Berners-Lee made a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop.</p>
